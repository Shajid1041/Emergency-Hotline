getElementById:
This is used to select an element based on its ID, and if there are two elements with the same ID, then it throws an error. It only returns a single element.

getElementsByClassName:
This is used to select elements based on the class name, and even if there are multiple elements with the same class name, it doesnâ€™t throw an error because it returns a collection of elements in an array-like object (not an actual array).

querySelector:
With querySelector, we can select elements in the same way we traverse HTML elements inside a CSS file or style tag. But if there are multiple results with the same name, it only returns the first one it finds.

querySelectorAll:
This works exactly like querySelector, but in the case of multiple results, it returns all the results as a collection in an array-like object.
